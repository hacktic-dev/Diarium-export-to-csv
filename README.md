# Diarium-export-to-csv

Convert the exported Diarium contents to a csv file for import into other programs.

Exported data should be exported with the 'create a separate file for each date' option, and exported as .txt files. Extract these .txt files into a directory named 'Entries', placed in the same directory as the .py script.
